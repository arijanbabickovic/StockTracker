Fully operational Rails web-app that allows users to:

-check live stock prices through the IEX Cloud API
-add stocks to your portfolio for easier access
-follow other users and see what stocks they are following

Used Ruby 2.7.2, Rails 6 and Bootstrap 5.0 for some very basic styling. 

Deployed to Heroku:
